How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Using user stories helps clarify what is needed and expected as clear and concise descriptions are provided in order to steer the project in the right direction. 
By analyzing each story, we are able to define specific features, prioritize each based on their importance, and create a solution to address them. 
By keeping the requirements clear and adaptable, user stories allow development to remain user-centric and flexible throughout the project.
